So, you want to contribute to this project! That's awesome. However, before
doing so, please read the following simple steps how to contribute. This will
make the life easier and will avoid wasting time on things which are not
requested. :sparkless:


1. First of all, open an issue in the repository, using the [bug tracker][1],
   describing the contribution you'd like to make, the bug you found or any
   other ideas you have. This will help us to get you started on the right
   foot.

   If it makes sense, add the platform and software information (e.g. operating
   system, Node.JS version etc), screenshots (so we can see what you're seeing).

2. It's recommended to wait for feedback before going to next steps. However,
   if the issue is clear (e.g. typo) and the fix is simple, you can continue
   and fix it.

3. Fork the project in your account and create a new branch:
   `your-great-feature`.

4. Commit your changes in that branch and write the code following the
   [code style][2]. If the project contains tests (generally, the `test`
   directory), you are encouraged to add a test as well.

5. If the project contains a `package.json` file add yourself in the
   `contributors` array (if it doesn't exist, create it):

   ```json
   {
      "contributors": [
         "Your Name <and@email.address> (http://your.website)
      ]
   }
   ```

6. Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request
   message (e.g. *fixes #<your-issue-number*). Write a good description and
   title, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.

7. Kindly wait for feedback. :smile:

Thanks!
